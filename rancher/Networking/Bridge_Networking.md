# Bridge Networking


- In a standard Docker installation, the Docker daemon creates a bridge on the host with the name of docker0. 
When a container launches, Docker then creates a virtual ethernet device for it. This device appears within the container as `eth0` and on 
the host with a name like vethxxxwhere xxx is a unique identifier for the interface. The `vethxxx `interface is added to the docker0 bridge,
and this enables communication with other containers on the same host that also use the default bridge. To demonstrate using the default bridge, 
run the following command on a host with Docker installed.
Since we are not specifying the network - the container will connect to the default bridge when it launches.

Run the `ip addr` and `ip route `commands inside of the container.  You will see the IP address of the container with the `eth0` interface:

```
$ docker run -it --rm busybox /bin/sh
/ # ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
7: eth0@if8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue 
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
/ # 



```
n another terminal connected to the host, run the ip addr command. You will see the corresponding interface created for the container.
In the image below it is named veth5dd2b68@if9. Yours will be different.

```
$ ip addr | grep -A 50 veth

```
In another terminal connected to the host, run the ip addr command. You will see the corresponding interface created for the container. In the image below it is named veth5dd2b68@if9. Yours will be different.Although Docker mapped the container IPs on the bridge, network services running inside of the container are not visible outside of the host. To make them visible, the Docker Engine must be told when launching a container to map ports from that container to ports on the host. This process is called publishing. 
For example, if you want to map port 80 of a container to port 8080 on the host, then you would have to publish the port as shown in the following command:

```
docker run --name nginx -p 8080:80 nginx

The Docker daemon creates a rule within Netfilter that modifies outbound packets and changes the source address to be the address of the host itself. The Netfilter configuration allows inbound traffic via the rules that Docker creates when initially publishing the container's ports.The output included below 
shows the Netfilter rules created by Docker when it publishes a containerâ€™s ports.

```
$ docker run -p 8080:80 --name web -d nginx
